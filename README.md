Launch29 was a freelance project project that I worked on for a wine consultancy company. 

This is the server and client side code for the initial Launch 29 website. Site was used solely as a landing page for promotional efforts and to collect email addresses from interested parties.

I continue to work on a freelance basis for this company implementing various custom coded changes on their current site as needed (vault29.com).
